# 🔐 Playfair Cipher Web App

A simple web-based encryption and decryption tool using the classic **Playfair Cipher** algorithm. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to help users encrypt or decrypt messages interactively through a friendly user interface.

## 🧠 What is the Playfair Cipher?

The Playfair Cipher is a classical encryption technique invented in 1854. It encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs) instead of single letters, making it more secure than simple substitution ciphers. It uses a 5x5 matrix constructed from a keyword.
